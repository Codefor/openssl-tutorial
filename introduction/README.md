The openssl command-line binary that ships with the OpenSSL libraries can perform a wide range of cryptographic operations. It can come in handy in scripts or for accomplishing one-time command-line tasks.

Documentation for using the openssl application is somewhat scattered, however, so this article aims to provide some practical examples of its use. I assume that you’ve already got a functional OpenSSL installation and that the openssl binary is in your shell’s PATH.

Just to be clear, this article is strictly practical; it does not concern cryptographic theory and concepts. If you don’t know what an MD5 sum is, this article won’t enlighten you one bit—but if all you need to know is how to use openssl to generate a file sum, you’re in luck.

The nature of this article is that I’ll be adding new examples incrementally. Check back at a later date if I haven’t gotten to the information you need.
